# Math Quiz Chatbot
This Flutter project is a chatbot that quizzes children on their mathematical concepts through integration with Dialogflow. The chatbot is designed to ask a series of questions and provide feedback based on the answers given by the user.

# Getting Started
To get started with the Math Quiz Chatbot, clone this repository to your local machine and open it in your preferred IDE.

You will need to set up a Dialogflow agent and configure it to handle user input and provide responses. You can find more information on how to do this in the Dialogflow documentation.

Once you have set up your Dialogflow agent, you will need to update the lib/dialog_flow.dart file with your own credentials. Replace the const _kApiKey and const _kProjectId values with your own API key and project ID.

You can then run the app in your preferred emulator or device by running the flutter run command.

# Usage
The Math Quiz Chatbot will ask a series of questions related to mathematical concepts. Users can respond to the questions by typing their answers in the chat interface.

The chatbot will provide feedback based on the answers given by the user. If the user provides a correct answer, the chatbot will provide positive feedback. If the user provides an incorrect answer, the chatbot will provide constructive feedback and encourage the user to try again.
